# DNABERT-2 Reconstruction Atlas decision log

> **Tier: T2 — provenance.**

## 2026-07-27 — Reset from favored hypotheses to a biological census

- Trigger: the atlas request and the prior DNABERT-2 instrument records.
- Evidence available: the unmerged core-promoter branch reached a qualified preflight but found the
  forward estimand ceiling below its precision target; the coupling branch stopped after BPE
  geometry and donor-specificity power made the assay non-adjudicable.
- Decision: start from current `origin/master` in a separate clean worktree and carry forward only
  the pinned adapter and explicit instrument lessons.
- Alternatives considered: extend either old branch; merge both; retain their scripts as active.
- Effect: no legacy target hypothesis or outcome is a live atlas claim. Legacy commits are indexed,
  not copied into the active study.

## 2026-07-27 — Make per-covered-nucleotide log probability primary

- Trigger: variable-length BPE tokens can overhang an annotated nucleotide interval.
- Decision: normalize the summed true-token log probability by the full minimal token cover.
- Rejected: normalize only by annotated length; average tokens equally; retokenize a string
  containing literal mask text.
- Effect: every result records annotated length, covered length, overhang, offsets, and token count.

## 2026-07-27 — Permit alternative margins only under exact geometry

- Trigger: editing a target can change BPE segmentation and ALiBi token distance.
- Decision: an alternative margin is eligible only if the full offset map is unchanged and every
  unmasked token ID is identical.
- Effect: ineligible alternatives are recorded rather than forced into a biased comparison.

## 2026-07-27 — Gate mechanisms on both excess behavior and context specificity

- Trigger: raw motif likelihood can reflect token frequency or local spelling.
- Decision: internal screens are prohibited until the site class beats empirical controls and a
  biologically structured, token-invariant source-region intervention.
- Effect: an attractive attention map cannot create an atlas mechanism row.

## 2026-07-27 — Keep the preflight threshold file as a draft

- Trigger: no atlas-wide development variance or positive-control calibration exists yet.
- Decision: implement the gate schema and lock candidate, but leave site-specific SESOIs and minimum
  cluster counts unset until outcome-blind/calibration evidence supports them.
- Effect: no target runner can qualify from the draft alone; a frozen owner-approved config and
  matching preflight report are required.
